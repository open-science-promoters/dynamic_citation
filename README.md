# the problem

Names are not static, but papers metadata is. A "correct" citation of a paper will therefore include names which are not accurate to the present naming of the person. This makes it difficult to merge them in a single list of publication for people who have change their names. This is particularly non-inclusive and eshausting for trans people.

This repository would like to gather expertise and use case on how to deal with the matter.


It started with a twitter discussion: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reminder for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AcademicTwitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AcademicTwitter</a>: if you&#39;re going to cite me, don&#39;t deadname me. You wouldn&#39;t do it in person or on a Zoom call, so why do you do it in your PDFs? Reviewers, editors: please check reference lists: I&#39;ve found &gt;100 references with my dead name in the last 3 months.</p>&mdash; Amy J.
